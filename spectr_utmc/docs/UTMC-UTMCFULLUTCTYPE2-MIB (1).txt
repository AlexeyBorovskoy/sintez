				Other values require the outstation to send an inform to the instation 
				after this time whether or not any reply data has 
				changed. If no reply data has changed the inform
				will only contain the timestamp object (utcType2OutstationTime). 
				
				If non-zero then
				1) this value should be greater than or equal to 
				the utcType2ScootSampleReportInterval
				2) this time should be greater than the Retry Delay * Retry Count.
				
				The purpose of this object is to allow the instation to process reply 
				data sooner that it might otherwise be able to do so. The instation
				can safely process data in a timely fashion and only delay processing
				of data when the reply data has truly been delayed.

				This is provided to prevent network overloading.
				
				The holdoff time starts when all the configured retries have timed out.

			DESCRIPTION
				"Condition 1 is the active output
				state on a SCOOT detector.
				Note: These are four sample
				bits per detector per second.
				
				The encoding is:
				   1        2       3
				(D2 D1)  (D4 D3)  (0 D5)  - SCOOT samples for second N
				
				   4        5       6
				(D2 D1)  (D4 D3)  (0 D5)  - SCOOT samples for second N-1
				
				   7        8       9
				(D2 D1)  (D4 D3)  (0 D5)  - SCOOT samples for second N-2
				
				   z
				(xx yy) represents an octet of data,
				        where xx is the most significant nibble and
				              yy is the least significant nibble
				              z is the octet number within the octet string
				
				D1 represents the 4 samples for SCOOT detector 1
				   taken over a second, with the most recent
				   sample in the least significant bit of the nibble.
				
				D2 represents the 4 samples for SCOOT detector 2, etc
				
				0 is a packing nibble, only required where there are
				  an odd number of SCOOT detectors.
				
				The timestamp on the reply table entry will represent
				the time at which the accumulation of the samples is concluded.
				
				The maximum number of seconds of data in an octet string
				is configured by utcType2ScootSampleReportInterval, although
				a report may contain less that this, where the data is
				sent before the full number of seconds have been accumulated."
